### Using the Context Menu
On part of interface where you'd like to execute command:

|     |                              | 
|-----|------------------------------| 
| RMB | Open respective context menu | 

<br>
It is worth noting that Live’s context menu may sometimes contain applicable settings from the Preferences. You should change these options with care, as they will affect not only the currently selected item but the general settings of the program.

<br>
Some commands only appear in the context menu. Among these are: various options for working with the browser (see 5.1); the special grid marker commands for directing Auto-Warp (see “Syncing Longer Pieces”); detailed options for zoom-adaptive and fixed grid line width (see 6.9); copying and pasting for Operator’s envelopes and oscillators (see 24.6); and numerous device-specific commands.
